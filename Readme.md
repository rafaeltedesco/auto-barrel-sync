### Description

*auto-barrel-sync* is a Node.js module that simplifies the process of auto-generating a barrel file for your project. A barrel file is used to consolidate and export multiple modules from different folders, making it easier to import them in other parts of your application.

### Installation
You can install My Package using npm:

```bash
npm install auto-barrel-sync
```

### Usage
To use My Package in your Node.js project, follow these steps:

1 - Create your desired folder structure inside *src*. 

### Example:

- src
  - controllers
  - services
  - utils

2 - Inside each folder, create your modules.  

### Example:

- src
  - utils
    - calculatorUtil.js

3 - Inside calculatorUtil.js create your functions and export as an object with a name. 

### Example:

```javascript
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;

module.exports = {
  name: 'CalculatorUtil',
  sum,
  subtract
}

```

4 - Import the package:

```javascript

const Barrels = require('auto-barrel-sync');
```

The barrel object will contain the exported modules from your specified folders such as CalculatorUtil.

So, you can also use as:

```javascript
const { CalculatorUtil } = require('auto-barrel-sync');

calculatorUtil.sum(10, 20);
calculatorUtil.subtract(20, 30);

```

Notice that the the *auto-barrel-sync* use the name you added when you create an object to export your functions.

### See more examples of usage bellow:

```javascript

const { Services, Controllers } = Barrels;
const { UserService, AuthService } = Services;
const { UserController, AuthController } = Controllers;
```

### Configuration

By default, *auto-barrel-sync* looks for folders in the src directory. At the moment you cannot customize.
